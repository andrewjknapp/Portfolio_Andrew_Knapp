# Portfolio_Andrew_Knapp

## Project purpose
This site was a practice exercise in building a website using only html and bootstrap. This will be used as a template once I create my own portfolio later on.

## Steps taken in creating the site

 - Created the html files and planned out how they would be mapped.
 - Looked through Bootstrap documentation for components to implement in site
 - Created header with nav and the footer to be used on each page included
 - Created container with about me section and formatted page
 - Used bootstrap card and form to create contact page
 - Used bootstrap rows and columns to create layout for portfolio page
 - Created placeholder for eventual projects for portfolio page
 - Further adjustments including formatting and color coices
